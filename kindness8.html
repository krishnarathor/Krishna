    <p>One thing people today overlook far too much is the simple yet effective act of kindness. In this cold
        <br> new world overtaken by selfishness and greed is a desperate need for those little acts of care. Just a
        <br> helping hand or a quick show of compassion can turn another person’s day completely around.</p>
    <p>Sometimes even a friendly smile can save a life. People often forget others and become very engrossed
        <br> in their own problems. This leads to a negative downward spiral and a chain reaction of selfishness. A
        <br> generation of selfish people is the last thing we need today. Imagine if everybody was willing to be
        <br> kind and compassionate to each other. If it was not forced, but a habit. This would change the world.</p>

    <p>Everyone has experienced difficult times at one time or another when things were not going well and needed
        <br> an act of kindness to brighten up their day. If it wasn’t for that one person, that one act of kindness, they might
        <br> not have the life they have today. Remember how effective just the smallest act of kindness can be. Know that
        <br> you can do this for others. In the long run, you may not be just helping one person but multiple people.
        <br> Kindness is like the spark from a match that creates a forest fire. The forest is a forest of anger, selfishness,
        <br> and cruelty. Kindness can burn through all of those things.</p>
    <p>It’s very important for people to remember that anger is powerful. So is selfishness along with cruelty.
        <br> However, kindness overpowers all. You may think your kindness makes a difference for other people only, but
        <br> it doesn’t. What comes around goes around, and your act will be returned. Your most important reward is
        <br> knowing how much you just helped someone in need. You feel satisfaction knowing that you might have
        <br> saved someone’s day, week, or even life. What you have really been given is the most precious gift you can
        <br> receive, the gift of kindness. Everyone is capable of being kind. Everyone can help. The real question is, why
        <br> don’t we? This should not be a question. Kindness should come automatically. It should be common rather
        <br> than a rarity. We can make this happen and do something kind today.</p>
    <p>“No matter how small, an act of kindness never goes unnoticed.”</p>
